# Verba Volant: Technical Roadmap

## Project Overview
A forensics-resistant web chat service with end-to-end encryption using Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The system prioritizes privacy, forward secrecy, and resistance to forensic analysis.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Milestone 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [X] Initialize Node.js project structure
- [X] Set up package.json with dependencies (ws, crypto modules)
- [X] Create basic folder structure (src/server, src/client, public)
- [X] Configure development environment and build tools
- [X] Set up basic HTML/CSS structure for client interface

### 1.2 WebSocket Server Implementation
- [X] Create basic WebSocket server using `ws` library
- [X] Implement room management system (join/leave rooms)
- [X] Add connection handling and client tracking
- [ ] Implement message routing between clients in same room
- [X] Add basic error handling and connection cleanup

### 1.3 Basic Client Interface
- [X] Create HTML structure with Send and Receive areas
- [X] Implement room join functionality, only two participants allowed Alice and Bob. Also in the webpage, put name 'Alice' in the UI. When the second user joins put name 'Bob' in his UI. Do not accept more participants.
- [X] Add basic WebSocket client connection
- [X] Create message input/output interface
- [X] Add connection status indicators
- [X] Once connected to a room the room id can't be changed by user, add a leave button and reload the page as a fresh session

**Security Requirement**: All client code must be self-contained and never downloaded from the server. Client files should be distributed separately for user verification and local execution.

## Phase 2: Cryptographic Implementation (Milestone 2)

### 2.1 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- [X] Implement DH key pair generation using Web Crypto API with both "deriveKey" and "deriveBits" usages for ECDH operations
- [X] Create key exchange message format (pubkey type)
- [X] Add public key transmission via WebSocket
- [X] Implement shared secret derivation from DH exchange using deriveBits() to get raw key material for HKDF input, show in the UI of participants that the secret has been derived.
- [X] Add key exchange state management

### 2.2 AES-GCM Encryption System
- [X] Implement AES key derivation using HKDF/SHA-256 from ECDH raw key material, use deterministic salt for consistent key derivation between participants, update status in UI when AES key is ready
- [X] Create AES-GCM encryption functions with encryptMessage() that generates random 12-byte IV and returns {ciphertext, iv} object
- [X] Add IV/nonce generation for each message using crypto.getRandomValues() with 12 bytes for GCM mode
- [X] Implement decryption functions with decryptMessage() that takes ciphertext, iv, and aesKey parameters
- [X] Add encryption error handling with try-catch blocks and detailed error logging
- [X] Update UI when encryption is ready: change placeholder text, button text to "Send Encrypted", show "Ready for encrypted messaging" status with pulse animation

### 2.3 Message Encryption Flow
- [X] Integrate encryption into message sending: check keyExchangeCompleted && aesKey, encrypt with encryptMessage(), send as 'encrypted_message' type with ciphertext/iv arrays and sender role
- [X] Implement encrypted message format with server relay: ciphertext + IV as byte arrays, sender identification, server broadcasts to room excluding sender
- [X] Default encrypted display with individual toggle: messages show encrypted by default (globalShowPlaintext=false), each message has lock/unlock icon (ðŸ”’/ðŸ”“) in message header beside sender name, click toggles between hex preview and plaintext
- [X] Individual message encryption toggle: both sent and received messages have clickable lock icons, encrypted text shows as "ðŸ”’ [hex20bytes...]", stores encryptedData and plaintextContent on messageDiv DOM element
- [X] Global lock/unlock all button: positioned below security status outside scrolling area, button text shows action to perform ("ðŸ”“ Unlock All" when locked, "ðŸ”’ Lock All" when unlocked), applies to all messages with encryption data
- [X] Message structure with encryption: message header contains sender name and lock icon, message content shows encrypted hex or plaintext based on state, auto-scroll with multiple timing attempts for visibility
