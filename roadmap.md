# Verba Volant: Technical Roadmap

## Project Overview
A forensics-resistant web chat service with end-to-end encryption using Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The system prioritizes privacy, forward secrecy, and resistance to forensic analysis.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Milestone 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [X] Initialize Node.js project structure
- [X] Set up package.json with dependencies (ws, crypto modules)
- [X] Create basic folder structure (src/server, src/client, public)
- [X] Configure development environment and build tools
- [X] Set up basic HTML/CSS structure for client interface

### 1.2 WebSocket Server Implementation
- [X] Create basic WebSocket server using `ws` library
- [X] Implement room management system (join/leave rooms)
- [X] Add connection handling and client tracking
- [ ] Implement message routing between clients in same room
- [X] Add basic error handling and connection cleanup

### 1.3 Basic Client Interface
- [X] Create HTML structure with Send and Receive areas
- [X] Implement room join functionality, only two participants allowed Alice and Bob. Also in the webpage, put name 'Alice' in the UI. When the second user joins put name 'Bob' in his UI. Do not accept more participants.
- [X] Add basic WebSocket client connection
- [X] Create message input/output interface
- [X] Add connection status indicators
- [X] Once connected to a room the room id can't be changed by user, add a leave button and reload the page as a fresh session

**Security Requirement**: All client code must be self-contained and never downloaded from the server. Client files should be distributed separately for user verification and local execution.

## Phase 2: Cryptographic Implementation (Milestone 2)

### 2.1 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- [X] Implement DH key pair generation using Web Crypto API with both "deriveKey" and "deriveBits" usages for ECDH operations
- [X] Create key exchange message format (pubkey type)
- [X] Add public key transmission via WebSocket
- [X] Implement shared secret derivation from DH exchange using deriveBits() to get raw key material for HKDF input, show in the UI of participants that the secret has been derived.
- [X] Add key exchange state management

### 2.2 AES-GCM Encryption System
- [X] Implement AES key derivation using HKDF/SHA-256 from ECDH raw key material, use deterministic salt for consistent key derivation between participants, update status in UI when AES key is ready
- [X] Create AES-GCM encryption functions with encryptMessage() that generates random 12-byte IV and returns {ciphertext, iv} object
- [X] Add IV/nonce generation for each message using crypto.getRandomValues() with 12 bytes for GCM mode
- [X] Implement decryption functions with decryptMessage() that takes ciphertext, iv, and aesKey parameters
- [X] Add encryption error handling with try-catch blocks and detailed error logging
- [X] Update UI when encryption is ready: change placeholder text, button text to "Send Encrypted", show "Ready for encrypted messaging" status with pulse animation

### 2.3 Message Encryption Flow
- [X] Integrate encryption into message sending: check keyExchangeCompleted && aesKey, encrypt with encryptMessage(), send as 'encrypted_message' type with ciphertext/iv arrays and sender role
- [X] Implement encrypted message format with server relay: ciphertext + IV as byte arrays, sender identification, server broadcasts to room excluding sender
- [X] Default encrypted display with individual toggle: messages show encrypted by default (globalShowPlaintext=false), each message has lock/unlock icon (ðŸ”’/ðŸ”“) in message header beside sender name, click toggles between hex preview and plaintext
- [X] Individual message encryption toggle: both sent and received messages have clickable lock icons, encrypted text shows as "ðŸ”’ [hex20bytes...]", stores encryptedData and plaintextContent on messageDiv DOM element
- [X] Global lock/unlock all button: positioned below security status outside scrolling area, button text shows action to perform ("ðŸ”“ Unlock All" when locked, "ðŸ”’ Lock All" when unlocked), applies to all messages with encryption data
- [X] Message structure with encryption: message header contains sender name and lock icon, message content shows encrypted hex or plaintext based on state, auto-scroll with multiple timing attempts for visibility
- [X] **ENHANCED SECURITY**: Updated lock behavior to hold-to-view mode: messages display encrypted ciphertext by default, individual lock icons require holding down (mousedown/touchstart) to temporarily show plaintext, global "Hold to Show All" button works similarly - all messages return to encrypted state when released for maximum security


### 2.4 Recent Security Enhancements (December 2024)
- [X] **Hold-to-View Security Model**: Implemented enhanced security where encrypted messages are displayed as ciphertext by default with no persistent plaintext visibility
- [X] **Individual Message Security**: Each message lock icon (ðŸ”’) requires active holding (mouse/touch) to temporarily reveal plaintext - releases immediately when pressure stops
- [X] **Global Message Security**: "Hold to Show All" button (ðŸ”’ Hold to Show All) applies hold-to-view behavior to all encrypted messages simultaneously
- [X] **Multi-Platform Support**: Added both mouse events (mousedown/mouseup/mouseleave) and touch events (touchstart/touchend) for mobile compatibility
- [X] **Forensic Resistance**: Enhanced forensic resistance by eliminating persistent plaintext display - messages automatically return to encrypted state without user action
- [X] **UI/UX Security**: Updated button labels and tooltips to clearly indicate hold-to-view functionality, preventing accidental plaintext exposure

## Phase 3: MITM Protection & BIP39 Authentication (Milestone 3)

### 3.1 BIP39 Wordlist Integration
- [X] Import BIP39 English wordlist (2048 words) into client code
- [X] Create wordlist validation and lookup functions
- [X] Implement bit-to-word mapping functions (11 bits per word)
- [X] Add word-to-index conversion for verification
- [X] Test wordlist integrity and completeness

### 3.2 Fingerprint Generation System
- [X] Implement public key ordering function (canonical order for consistency)
- [X] Create SHA-256 hash function for combined public keys: `hash = SHA-256(ordered(pubkeyA, pubkeyB))`
- [X] Extract first NÃ—11 bits from hash (default N=5 for 55-bit security)
- [X] Map extracted bits to BIP39 words using bit slicing
